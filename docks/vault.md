Certainly! Below is a markdown document that you can use for your GitHub repository. This document outlines the steps and commands you used to initialize, unseal, and configure HashiCorp Vault in a Kubernetes environment using Minikube.

# HashiCorp Vault Deployment on Minikube

This document provides a step-by-step guide to deploying, initializing, and unsealing HashiCorp Vault on a Minikube cluster using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Minikube installed and running
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured
- HashiCorp Vault deployed in the Kubernetes cluster

## Steps to Initialize and Unseal Vault

### 1. Check Vault Pod Status

Ensure that the Vault pod is running in the `vault-deployment` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n vault-deployment
```

### 2. Initialize Vault

Initialize the Vault to generate unseal keys and the root token. This step is performed inside the Vault pod.

```bash
kubectl exec -it vault-69b4c7886-qsr9m -n vault-deployment -- sh -c "export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true && vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3"
```

**Output:**

- **Unseal Keys:** 5 keys are generated. You need at least 3 to unseal the Vault.
- **Initial Root Token:** A root token is generated for administrative access.

### 3. Unseal Vault

Use the unseal keys to unseal the Vault. You need to provide at least 3 keys.

```bash
kubectl exec -it vault-69b4c7886-qsr9m -n vault-deployment -- sh -c "export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true && vault operator unseal <Unseal_Key_1>"
kubectl exec -it vault-69b4c7886-qsr9m -n vault-deployment -- sh -c "export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true && vault operator unseal <Unseal_Key_2>"
kubectl exec -it vault-69b4c7886-qsr9m -n vault-deployment -- sh -c "export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true && vault operator unseal <Unseal_Key_3>"
```

### 4. Login to Vault

Use the initial root token to log in to Vault.

```bash
vault login <Initial_Root_Token>
```

## Important Considerations

- **Security:** Store unseal keys and the root token securely. They should only be accessible to authorized personnel.
- **SSL Verification:** Skipping SSL verification is a security risk and should only be done in non-production environments.
- **Auto Unseal:** Consider using Vault's Auto Unseal feature for production environments to manage unseal keys securely.
