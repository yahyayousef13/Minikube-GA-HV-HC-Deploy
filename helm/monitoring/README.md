# Monitoring Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for setting up and managing the monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. Below is a description of each file and its purpose.

## Files

### 1. `prometheus-values.yaml`

- **Purpose**: This file contains custom values for deploying Prometheus using Helm.
- **Contents**:
  - **Global Settings**: Defines global settings like `scrape_interval`.
  - **Scrape Configurations**: Specifies which targets Prometheus should scrape for metrics.
  - **Alertmanager Configuration**: Includes settings for integrating with Alertmanager.
  - **Usage**: Modify this file to change Prometheus settings and add new scrape targets.

### 2. `prometheus-rules.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Contains alerting rules for Prometheus.
- **Contents**:
  - **Alert Groups**: Organizes alerts into groups for better management.
  - **Alert Rules**: Defines conditions under which alerts should be triggered.
- **Usage**: Update this file to add or modify alerting rules. Ensure it is referenced in `prometheus-values.yaml` under `rule_files`.

### 3. `alertmanager-config.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Configures Alertmanager for handling alerts sent by Prometheus.
- **Contents**:
  - **Global Settings**: Includes global settings like `resolve_timeout`.
  - **Routes and Receivers**: Defines how alerts are routed and where notifications are sent (e.g., Slack).
- **Usage**: Modify this file to change alert routing and notification settings.

### 4. `grafana-values.yaml`

- **Purpose**: Contains custom values for deploying Grafana using Helm.
- **Contents**:
  - **Admin Credentials**: Sets the admin username and password for Grafana.
  - **Data Sources**: Configures data sources, such as Prometheus, for Grafana.
- **Usage**: Update this file to change Grafana settings, such as admin credentials and data source configurations.

## Deployment

To deploy the monitoring stack, use the following Helm commands:

```bash
# Deploy Prometheus
helm upgrade --install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace monitoring --create-namespace -f prometheus-values.yaml

# Deploy Grafana
helm upgrade --install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring -f grafana-values.yaml













### Additional Tips

- **Keep It Updated**: Regularly update the `README.md` file as configurations change or new files are added.
- **Use Markdown Features**: Utilize markdown features like headings, lists, and code blocks to make the document easy to read and navigate.
- **Link to Resources**: Consider linking to external resources or documentation for more detailed information on Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

By maintaining a well-documented `README.md`, you can ensure that your monitoring setup is transparent and accessible to anyone working on the project. If you have any further questions or need more specific guidance, feel free to ask!
